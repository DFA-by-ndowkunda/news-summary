          "bodyText": "At the beginning and end of minute’s silence ahead of the funeral service, the Armed Forces conducted a Ceremonial Gun Fire at nine locations. At Edinburgh Castle, a gun salute was fired at 3pm, followed by a single round at 3pm. In London, a gun salute was fired at the same time at The Tower of London. In Northern Ireland, First Minister Arlene Foster marked the minute’s silence. Due to coronavirus restrictions, the Queen was forced to sit alone during today’s service. Over in Corfu, the Duke of Edinburgh’s birthplace, a memorial service has been conducted in honour of Philip. The royal was reputedly born on the kitchen table of the Mon Repos palace at 10 AM on June 10, 1921. “He was born here, he is part of our history,” Corfu’s mayor Meropi Ydraiou, told the Guardian. “His death has been widely discussed. It’s touched a lot of older people who still have memories of the royal family and has been cause for the younger generation to learn about our island’s past.” In a rare honour, the 40-minute memorial was overseen by Corfu’s leading cleric, Bishop Nektarios, in the Cathedral of Ayios Spyridonas. Sixth in line to the Greek throne, the prince was registered at Corfu’s Town Hall under the name of Philippos. The then mayor, Alexandros Kokotos, was among the five godparents of the baby boy. “He was appointed Philip’s godfather in the name of the town hall and the people of Corfu which is why the prince holds a place of special affection in our hearts,” said Ydraiou. Built by the British, when the United States of the Ionian Islands were a British protectorate, the neo-classical villa was used by the royals as a summer palace until the monarchy was ousted by popular referndum in 1974. Philip, who was whisked out of the island as a toddler after his father was threatened with execution for his role in Greece’s catastrophic 1922 Asia Minor campaign, only ever returned once. In recent days members of the island’s large 9,000 strong British community have been laying flowers at the entrance of the estate. The Queen is being driven away from the chapel, back to her royal apartment. Meanwhile, other members of the family are chatting outside the chapel as they leave the service. Princes Harry and William are walking and talking together. The service is now over, and the Queen is being led by the dean Windsor out of the chapel. Members of the royal family follow her out. In the background, Luke Bond, the assistant director of music at St George’s Chapel, plays Prelude and Fugue in C minor, BWV 546, by Johann Sebastian Bach. Outside the chapel the scene is much quieter, with the military personnel who were stationed outside having now departed. The choir is now singing the national anthem as the attendees stand. The Lament has just been played by the pipe major of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. Now, the buglers of the Royal Marines will sound The Last Post. After a period of silence, state trumpeters of the Household Cavalry will sound Reveille, followed by the buglers of the Royal Marines sounding Action Stations. The coffin is now being lowered into Royal Vault, as members of the royal family stand. The dean of Windsor reads: Go forth upon thy journey from this world, O Christian soul, In the name of God the Father Almighty who created thee; In the name of Jesus Christ who suffered for thee; In the name of the Holy Spirit who strengtheneth thee; May thy portion this day be in peace, and thy dwelling in the heavenly Jerusalem. Amen. Philip’s titles are now being read out as his coffin is lowered. The archbishop of Canterbury said in a prayer: O eternal God, before whose face the generations rise and pass away, thyself unchanged, abiding, we bless thy holy name for all who have completed their earthly course in thy faith and following, and are now at rest; we remember before thee this day Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, rendering thanks unto thee - for his resolute faith and loyalty, for his high sense of duty and integrity, for his life of service to the nation and Commonwealth, and for the courage and inspiration of his leadership. To him, with all the faithful departed, grant thy peace; let light perpetual shine upon them; and in thy loving wisdom and almighty power work in them the good purpose of thy perfect will; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.” Princes William and Harry are sitting opposite one another in St George’s Chapel, as the brothers bid farewell to their grandfather. The pair, who have reportedly had a difficult relationship in recent years, joined a group of just 30 family members for the funeral, which has been downsized due to coronavirus restrictions. Attendees are seated in their household bubbles, so William is sat with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, while Harry is seated alone. He rushed back to the UK from his home in the US following news of Philip’s death, and has been self-isolating at Frogmore Cottage. His wife, Meghan, was advised not to make the journey due to being heavily pregnant. This is the first time Harry has been seen publicly with the Windsors since he and Meghan’s bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey last month over his departure from the royal family. The brothers are clad in medals, with the Duke of Cambridge wearing a garter star, Golden Jubilee Medal and Diamond Jubilee Medal. The Duke of Sussex is wearing a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order neck order, medal and star, a Golden Jubilee medal, Diamond Jubilee medal, and Afghanistan Service medal. A topless protester ran in front of a crowd near Windsor Castle shortly after the minute’s silence for the duke, shouting “save the planet”. She began shouting as the crowd began clapping following the silence, and jumped onto a statue of Queen Victoria before police officers removed her from the scene. The dean of Windsor read Ecclesiasticus 43. 11-26, which began: Look at the rainbow and praise its Maker; it shines with a supreme beauty, rounding the sky with its gleaming arc, a bow bent by the hands of the Most High. The choir, socially distanced and made up of just four people, then sang the Jubilate, which was written at the request of Philip. Now the archbishop of Canterbury is reading John 11. 21-27, before the choir sing Psalm 104, which the duke requested be put to music. A number of songs, chosen by Philip himself, will be played at the funeral. Here’s a little bit more information about why they might have been selected: Eternal Father One song in the order of service has particular significance for the Royal Navy, nodding to the duke’s connection to the force over eight decades. Eternal Father is often known as the hymn of the Royal Navy. Prince Philip enrolled at Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth aged 17, and served at sea during the second world war. He went on to hold a number of honorary ranks. The Rhosymedre The Rhosymedre by Ralph Vaughan William has a strong connection to the royals. It was played at the weddings of William and Kate, and Harry and Meghan, and was played at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. The Jubilate and Psalm 104 Two pieces of music Philip commissioned himself from celebrated composers will be featured at the service. The Jubilate in C was written by Benjamin Britten at the duke’s request around 1961, and has become a staple in cathedrals and churches across the UK. Psalm 104 was set to music by guitarist and composer William Lovelady, and first sung in honour of Philip’s 75th birthday in 1996. The funeral service has now begun. The blessing was pronounced by the dean of Windsor. He said: We are here today in St George’s Chapel to commit into the hands of God the soul of his servant Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. With grateful hearts, we remember the many ways in which his long life has been a blessing to us. We have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our Queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith. Our lives have been enriched through the challenges that he has set us, the encouragement that he has given us, his kindness, humour and humanity. We therefore pray that God will give us grace to follow his example, and that, with our brother Philip, at the last, we shall know the joys of life eternal.” The choir are now singing Eternal Father. Philip’s coffin is now being taken into the chapel, with members of the royal family following. The royals put on black face masks as they entered the chapel. A minute’s silence begins to remember Prince Philip. Hundreds of people fell silent in Windsor, with mourners lining up outside the castle pausing for the silence. On the nearby Long Walk, others did the same. The coffin is now being carried up the steps of the chapel. Members of the royal family who participated in the procession are lining up at the bottom of the steps, in preparation for the national minute’s silence at 3pm. The Queen has left her vehicle and entered the Gaililee porch, led by the dean of Windsor, and will be taken to her seat. The Queen travelled with her lady-in-waiting, Lady Susan Hussey, who has been with her for many decades. Hussey, 81, is very close to the family, acting as one of the Duke of Cambridge’s godparents. The Queen has arrived at Windsor Castle to join the procession behind her late husband’s coffin. The procession has begun walking towards the chapel. It is led by the duke’s eldest children, Charles and Anne, followed by Edward and Andrew, then princes William and Harry, separated by their cousin Peter Phillips. Other members of the royal family who were not involved in the procession, including the duchesses of Cambridge and Cornwall, lowered their heads as the coffin passed in a sign of respect. The coffin of the Duke of Edinburgh is being carried from Windsor Castle to the Land Rover that will carry him to the chapel, where he will be laid to rest. The coffin is draped with his personal standard, which references his birth heritage as a prince of Greece and Denmark, his family name and his Edinburgh title. The first three quarters show his lineage – with blue lions and red hearts on a yellow background representing Denmark, a white cross on blue representing Greece, and his anglicised family name Mountbatten represented with two black “pales” or stripes on white. The fourth quarter contains the arms of the city of Edinburgh. Philip’s children watched as the coffin was laid on the car. The card on the wreath left by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in St George’s Chapel was handwritten by Meghan, who is watching the funeral on television from the couple’s home in California. Meghan was advised against making the flight, as she is heavily pregnant with her and Harry’s second child. Meghan and Harry personally chose the locally sourced flowers for their tribute – including Acanthus mollis (Bear’s breeches), the national flower of Greece, to represent Philip’s heritage, and Eryngium (sea holly), to represent the Royal Marines. The wreath also features campanula for gratitude and everlasting love, rosemary to signify remembrance, lavender for devotion, alongside roses as a nod to June – Philip’s birth month. The Land Rover that will carry Philip’s coffin has been driven into the castle’s quadrangle and has stopped outside the Equerries’ entrance. The pallbearers, representing the principal organisations in the armed forces, are walking alongside the Land Rover. Members of the armed forces, stationed on the lawn, have lowered their heads in a mark of respect. Bands are playing Jerusalem. The polished and sturdy vehicle, with heavy-duty wheels and angular structure, is a nod to the duke’s practical nature and passion for functional design and engineering. The pallbearers include Chief of the Defence Staff Gen Sir Nicholas Carter, who is head of UK Armed Forces, along with the heads of the army, RAF and Royal Navy. The funeral attendees are now travelling to the chapel, in a snaking line of black cars. The Duchess of Cornwall, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex, dressed in mourning black and wearing face masks, were amongst those leaving the castle by car to make the short journey to the chapel. The adapted Land Rover, which Philip helped to design, is stationed outside Windsor Castle, ready to take the coffin to the funeral. The duke’s favourite driving carriage, accompanied by two of his grooms, has pulled into Windsor Castle ready for the procession of his coffin. It was pulled by two black Fell ponies, Balmoral Nevis and Notlaw Storm, to stand in the quadrangle. The dark green aluminium and steel four-wheeled carriage was built to the duke’s specifications eight years ago. Aged 91, he began to use it to ride around Windsor and other royal estates. The 30 attendees at the funeral will be social distanced and wearing face masks. They will be seated in their household bubbles. Members of the royal family who aren’t part of the procession are likely to arrive to take their seats in around 20 minutes. Prince Philip’s coffin will placed on the Land Rover he designed at around 2.40pm and the Queen will leave the sovereign entrance and go to her car. The family will gather and the procession will begin, lasting about 20 minutes. The Lord Chamberlain, the most senior official in the Queen’s household and in overall charge of the funeral, has moved to the inner hall where the duke’s coffin is lying. Baron Parker has also been joined by the dean of Windsor, David Conner, who will conduct the service, and the retired admiral Sir James Francis Perowne, who is constable and governor of Windsor Castle. Members of the UK armed forces and their counterparts from around the Commonwealth are marching intp position in preparation for the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral. There number of military personnel at the service has been reduced because of coronavirus restrictions, but 730 will still be in attendance. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have arrived at Windsor Castle for the funeral. Prince Charles, the duke’s eldest son, has also arrived. The archbishop of Canterbury has arrived at St George’s Chapel. Justin Welby will preside over the funeral with the dean of Windsor. The chief of the defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, has spoken of the pride felt among the armed forces over the Duke of Edinburgh. He said the funeral would be a “sombre moment” but also a “celebratory moment” of a life well lived. “I think there won’t be a serviceman or servicewoman on parade today who won’t have their chest swelling with pride,” he told Sky News. “We all have a huge regard for him. “We have a huge regard for his wartime record and the care that he showed for veterans and for those still serving, and it’ll be a sombre moment for us, but it will also be a celebratory moment, I think, because it was a special life and a life that was well lived.” A member of the military has offered more insight into the planning behind the service. Lt Col James Greaves said the Armed Forces had been “leaning into this as much as we can”, and that it had been “really full tilt ahead ever since we heard of His Royal Highness’s passing.” “We as a regiment, as the Grenadier Guards, we were straight away putting our bearer party front and centre, and just making sure that we were correctly prepared,” he told Sky News. “Collectively we’ve been training at Pirbright; it’s been socially distanced, absolutely Covid-compliant, but clearly we have been leaning into this as much as we can. “We know how much His Royal Highness meant, not only to all of our regiments and units that are here on parade but also to the nation, so we are absolutely reflecting that which he gave to us we would like to give back to him today.” Windsor is bathed in sun this morning. Some members of the public began laying flowers at the gates of Windsor Castle this morning, but the large crowds usually synonymous with royal events were nowhere to be seen, amid warnings from police to stay away from the area due to coronavirus restrictions. Road signs in the area instructed people to “avoid all non essential travel and do not gather at royal residences.” But authorities weren’t taking any chances; a large police presence has been put in place to prepare for possible crowds, with armed police officers seen patrolling around the castle this morning. Hundreds of officers and stewards clad in purple vests were stationed around the town, with police vans and motorbikes patrolling the roads. Five coaches each carrying dozens of people in military uniforms drove into the main entrance of Windsor Castle around 12.30pm. Traffic on the high street was temporarily blocked off by police officers on motorbikes to allow the large white vehicles to pass, while pedestrians were halted by stewards. Soldiers in the British Army have paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. In a video shared on the army’s official Twitter account, one soldier said: “On Saturday when we fire the guns, it’s going to be an overwhelming feeling of sadness, because I think that is when it will hit us, why we are actually firing the guns.” A fellow soldier said: “He has been an absolutely amazing servant to this country, the Commonwealth, what he has done. He has given his life, literally just given everything to the cause of being the right-hand person to Her Majesty the Queen.” Another said: “We have selected a variety of music, which conveys many messages which embody the DoE’s life: service to the Queen, to the country and to the Commonwealth. I think the music for everybody conveys those messages of service and duty from a life that’s well-lived by the Duke of Edinburgh.” Commemorations aren’t just taking place in Windsor today. The Duke of Edinburgh’s passing is being marked around the world: Malta In Malta, re-enactor members of the Malta Command WW2 Living History Group honoured Prince Philip outside Villa Guardamangia, where then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip stayed regularly between 1949 and 1951, in Pieta. Sweden A ceremony is taking place in Stockholm, Sweden, to honour the Duke of Edinburgh. In this picture, Prince Philip’s Royal Order of the Seraphim shield is placed in the Riddarholmen Church during the ceremony. Denmark Flags have been placed half mast at Amalienborg Palace to mark the funeral. Philip was born Prince of Greece and Denmark. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has praised the Duke of Edinburgh’s “remarkable legacy” of his namesake scheme, the Duke of Edinburgh’s award. “Today, my thoughts are with the Queen, everyone in the royal family and the British people who will be mourning and remembering Prince Philip,” he tweeted. St George’s Chapel is being prepared for the funeral, which begins at 3pm. The Duke of Edinburgh’s Insignias have been placed on the altar ahead of the service. A man has been charged with trespassing at Buckingham Palace with a knife. Police arrested a 46-year-old shortly after 11.30am on Thursday as he attempted to enter through a gate into a service yard at the rear of the palace. Chorrie Thompson, of Neasden, north-west London, was charged on Friday with trespass on a protected site and possession of a blade or sharp pointed article in a public place. He will appear in custody at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday, the Metropolitan police said. The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery processed along the Long Walk up to Windsor Castle at midday, as they prepared to mark the carrying of Prince Philip’s coffin. Hundreds of people watched as dozens of riders, wearing black, gold and red uniforms and carrying three guns, rode up to Cambridge Gate, where tributes to the Duke of Edinburgh have been laid throughout the week. Members of the regiment will fire minute guns from the east lawn of Windsor Castle as the coffin is taken from the castle to the chapel. The service has been reduced from 800 to just 30 people due to coronavirus restrictions, so has been limited to family. The procession will be led by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh’s children. Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Anne, the Princess Royal, will lead Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, Edward, Earl of Wessex and other family members walking behind the duke’s coffin. The Queen will join the funeral procession, travelling by car. Princes William and Harry, who have reportedly had a difficult relationship in recent years over Harry’s decision to pull away from the royal family, will not walk shoulder to shoulder but with their cousin Peter Phillips between them. Other attendees include Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, Sophie, Countess of Wessex and her children Viscount Severn and Lady Louise. Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, Anne’s husband, will also be in attendance. Zara and Mike Tindall, Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, Princess Eugenie and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, have also been invited. Also attending will be the two children of the Queen’s sister Princess Margaret, Viscount Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto, and Lady Sarah’s husband Daniel Chatto, alongside the Duke of Edinburgh’s close friend Countess Mountbatten of Burma. Other attendees include the Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Kent and Princess Alexandra, first cousins of the Queen. Three of Philip’s German relatives will also be at the funeral; Prince Bernhard of Baden, who is the grandson of the duke’s second sister Theodora; Prince Donatus, Landgrave of Hesse, the head of the house of Hesse into which the duke’s younger sister Cecile and Sophie married; and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the grandson of the duke’s elder sister Princess Margarita. The first minister of Wales has sent a flower wreath to the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral to offer “sincere condolences” on behalf of the country. The wreath, made out of white chrysanthemums and red roses, is accompanied by a short message written in English and Welsh by Mark Drakeford. The message says: “On behalf of the government and people of Wales. Cydymdeimlad diffuant – Sincere condolences.” Throughout the week, the Duke of Edinburgh’s coffin has been resting in Windsor Castle’s private chapel. At 11am, it was moved by a bearer party from the Queen’s Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards to the royal residence’s inner hall. Prince Philip was closely associated with the regiment, serving as colonel of the Grenadier Guards for 42 years. His coffin was covered with a wreath, his sword, naval cap and his personal standard. The Duke of Edinburgh was involved in organising all details of the ceremony. His coffin will even be carried by a Land Rover which he helped to design. There won’t be any eulogies or speeches from the family, but this is usual for royal funerals. Cameras will be allowed into the funeral so the public can share in the ceremony. You can read the timeline of events at the service here: The Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral is set to reference his “unwaveringly loyalty” to the Queen over their 73-year marriage. The service will also pay tribute to his “courage, fortitude and faith”. On the eve of the funeral yesterday, a personal photograph of the Queen and Prince Philip was released, relaxing together during a holiday in the Scottish Highlands on the Balmoral estate. On Friday, the archbishop of Canterbury said that while the Queen would behave “with extraordinary dignity and extraordinary courage”, saying goodbye to Philip would be an “anguished moment” for her. The archbishop of Canterbury and the dean of Windsor will reference the impact he had on the UK as the Queen’s consort, but there will be no eulogies or family readings – these are uncommon at royal funerals. In the Bidding, the dean of Windsor, will say: “We have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our Queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith. “Our lives have been enriched through the challenges that he has set us, the encouragement that he has given us, his kindness, humour and humanity.” You can read more on the service’s nods to the Queen and Prince Philip’s decades-long marriage here: Hello and welcome to our live blog on the funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, which will be taking place in Windsor today. Due to coronavirus restrictions, there will be just 30 attendees at St George’s Chapel, situated on the grounds of Windsor Castle. I’ll be bringing you updates on the build up to the ceremony, which begins at 3pm, and news as it progresses. If you are marking the funeral in some way, are in Windsor, or simply spot something we should be reporting on in this blog, feel free to send me a message on Twitter.",

          "bodyText": "Player of the Match Marjorie Mayans ‘We expected a big team, we prepared really well. We didn’t expect such a score it was a surprise.’ On England: ‘We’re going to prepare exactly the same but we still have a week to prepare, we will be ready.’ A clinical but not perfect performance from France sees them bag a spot in the Women’s Six Nations final next week against England. Ireland conceded 20 penalties in the match which was the downfall for the hosts today. When they had ball in hand they looked dangerous but they just couldn’t finish off many opportunities. This sets up a huge match next week between France and their rivals England. 79 min: A hugely powerful scrum sees France win back the ball. Diallo sets them off to build a try from halfway. 78 min: France’s scrum works well again as they look to close out this match in attack. However, another knock-on. France’s play hasn’t been perfect this afternoon and they have forced a lot of errors. Ireland scum. 77 min: France’s Marjorie Mayans has been named Player of the Match 77 min: The Irish line-out goes awry and then possession exchanges hands quickly. 76 min: Ireland win another penalty as France don’t roll away. Griffin chips and chases but it bounces into touch, Ireland line-out. 74 min: Ireland’s line-out is good and they form a maul to send Hooban to crash over. A good reward for their attacking play throughout the match. Flood converts. 73 min: France are ruled offside and Flood kicks to the corner. Can they get their second try here? There is a lot of talk in commentary about the gap between these teams. It is good to note that the French players have had more consistent playing time throughout the pandemic and the visitors are in a semi-professional set-up. France run the ball off the back of the scrum and Banet goes over. Drouin doesn’t convert. The visitors have now scored more points against Ireland than they did against Wales. 70 min: Griffin rejoins her team for the scrum. Great to see her remain on the pitch 70 min: Ireland’s captain Griffin is down injured, hopefully this isn’t too bad! 70 min: France win a penalty at the scrum in a tale so familiar in this match. Ireland get a foot hold and then it is ripped away by France. 69 min: A break in play as players receive medical attention. A good breather in this tense clash! 69 min: Ireland do really well to fend off France there as they set up a powerful counter-ruck. The hosts kick on to gain territory but it goes dead. 67 min: What great defence from Flood! Traore was in possession after clinical offloads but Flood gets her body position perfect to turn the ball over. 66 min: Another momentum swing here in France’s favour as they play with an extra player. The tempo of the ball through the hands is lightning pace to cause dangerous attack. Drouin converts a penalty after Murphy Crowe gets sin binned on her 15s debut. She was high on Boujard but she doesn’t have the force to be a red. The TMO are looking to see if Murphy Crowe committed a high tackle on Boujard. Will there be a card here? 65 min: France were back in attack and they gain another penalty as Ireland didn’t roll away. 64 min: Wow, that was a huge break from Drouin! Ireland do well to turn the ball over as Considine was left in a one on one with Banet. 63 min: France are once again back in possession as Ireland collapse the scrum. These errors have cost the hosts the match, they were much more clinical and cohesive against Wales. 62 min: More changes for France Deshaye and Neiesen is off and Vernier and Traore on. 62 min: Unfortunately for Ireland they knock it on just as they were displaying their best attacking phases of the match. France are clinical in attack and defence at the moment. 61 min: Ireland win a penalty after solid attacking phases. They take the ball quickly through Flood. 60 min: France knock on but play goes on as Ireland collect quickly. They do need to score soon if they want to close the gap on France. 59 min: France go early at the scrum and Ireland kicks upfield. France collect and look to build from their own half. 59 min: More changes for Ireland. Peat and Moloney off and Hooban and O’Dwyer on 57 min: Hogan knocks on in the attacking play from the restart France kick to corner. What a well worked team try from France! They move the ball through the hands off of the back of the line-out which sends sub Menager over. Drouin misses the conversion 55 min: France subs as Sansus aand Hermet are off and Bourdon and Diallo is on. The visitors are building attack here now 54 min: The line-out isn’t clean and France regain possession.

Who will come away with the victory and a chance to win the Women’s Six Nations? A win or a draw will be enough to see France through but Ireland need a win here to go through. There’s a moment’s silence for rugby against racism with the anthems following shortly.. Teams are coming out to the pitch. Just a few minutes to go until this fixture kicks off. Less than 15 minutes away from this fixture kicking off! The particular battles to watch today will be at fly-half as last week’s Player of the Match Hannah Tyrrell will be up against France’s Caroline Drouin. And it’s set to be a hugely physical battle in the front row as Lindsay Peat, Cliodhna Moloney and Linda Djougang go up against Annaelle Deshaye, Agathe Sochat and Rose Bernadou. Ireland are aware of the challenge ahead but last week’s 45-0 win over Wales have invigorated them to aim for victory. Head coach Adam Griggs said: “France are fourth in the world, it’s exciting to see where we’re at on our journey and how we match up. “A good start last week has given us confidence that we can cause an upset.” There’s under half an hour to go until this tense match gets underway. The question of whether the match would go ahead this week was raised due to Ireland’s Covid restrictions. However, the Irish government viewed France’s team as elite and so the fixture is going ahead. Who will join England in the final? Whoever wins the match this afternoon will play England in the final of the Women’s Six Nations next week. Due to Covid restrictions, the tournament is not being played as it usually would and it is following the men’s Autumn Nations Cup. Ireland have named an unchanged starting XV from their win over Wales last week which isn’t surprising after they put on such a dominant performance. Star scorers Beibhinn Parsons and Eimear Considine will be key in the match but it will also be interesting to so how Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe goes. The sevens international and prolific scorer could win her first 15s cap as she starts from the bench. While there’s huge change for France as they have made eight changes to their starting squad. Most significantly, there’s a new half-back partnership with Caroline Drouin and Laure Sansus and an all new centre pairing with Carla Neisen and Jade Ulutule. Ireland: Considine; Delany, Higgins, Naoupu, Parsons; Tyrrell, Dane; Peat, Moloney, Djougang, McDermott, Fryday, Wall, Molloy, Griffin. Replacements: Hooban, O’Dwyer, Feely, Hogan, O’Connor, Lane, Flood, Murphy Crowe. France: Boulard; Boujard, Neisen, Ulutule, Banet; Drouin, Sansus; Deshaye, Sochat, Bernadou, Fall, N’Diaye, Mayans, Hermet, Gros. Replacements: Touye, Traore, Joyeux, Diallo, Menager, Bourdon, Peyronnet, Vernier. Preamble Ireland’s clash against France this afternoon is set to be a nail-biter as the victor will face England in the Women’s Six Nations final. The Red Roses secured their spot after topping Pool A following victories over Scotland and Italy. However, Pool B has not been so clean cut as both Ireland and France have defeated Wales with bonus-point wins. This means the top of the pool is up for grabs. France will be favourites heading into the match due to previous results. The two teams didn’t play each other in the 2020 tournament due to Covid restrictions, but France defeated Ireland 47-17 in 2019 and 24-0 in 2018. However, France should not underestimate Ireland following last week’s clinical performance. It was Adam Griggs’ team’s first match in six months but it didn’t show as they dominated Wales to earn the bonus-point before half-time. The match is set to be a thriller and a great display of women’s rugby. The action at Energia Park kicks off at 2.15pm BST.",

Here is the man himself, mulling over his day’s work, </p> <p><em>“It’s very nice to play Championship cricket and pull the Red Rose on again. Having watched Simon Kerrigan bowl I knew I’d have a decent role to play and it was lovely to bowl a decent chunk of overs.”I was gutted to miss put on selection last week and just wanted to prove a point a guess.”</em><br></p> <p>On ‘that’ ball<br><em>“I was very frustrated after Kerrigan slogged me for a few and just thought ‘sack it’ and tried to really rip it and luckily it paid off. There were decent foot holes there and I tried to bowl it quite fast. I know it’s doing the rounds on Twitter but to produce that for the team is fantastic and I’m very happy. It’s nice to have it trending on Twitter after the winter I’ve had but it’s nice just to play cricket.”</em><br></p> <p>Round the grounds, we’re expecting a result at the<strong> Rose Bowl</strong> after Sam Northeast and Ian Holland ground salt into the wound opened by Mohammad Abbass’s (un)believable 6-11 against Middlesex. <strong>Lancs</strong> are very on top against <strong>Northants</strong>, the <strong>Yorkies</strong> slept happy against <strong>Kent</strong>, <strong>Sussex</strong> batting out of their skins against <strong>Glamorgan</strong>, even stevens at <strong>Taunton</strong> and hundreds a-waiting to be collected by Pope and Foakes at <strong>Surrey</strong>, and Hameed and Clarke at Trent Bridge as <strong>Notts</strong> stare down that rare beast victory. </p> <p>The big question - can <strong>Durham</strong> really go on and beat the County Champions today, unbeaten at home for nearly three years? <strong>Essex</strong> just 45 ahead, a mere four wickets in hand.

If he has a better career than his doppelganger Ian Ronald Bell, I’ll be a happy man. He’s got time and talent on his side, so anything’s possible.” The two teams line up facing the pavillion, socially distanced, the support staff behind, the umpires in between. The Lancashire players remove their caps and place them in a line in front of their toes. The pavilion bell is rung and everyone stands for the minute’s silence. And off they go, for an hour and 20 tea-plus break. Lancs 205-6 and scores round the grounds to follow. A hundred for Adam Lyth - just 142 balls, taking the Yorkies to a big, fat lead of 283. Northants start an over on the dot of the official mourning period as the press box TV gets turned over to the blue skies of Windsor and the funeral procession. Down at The Oval, Ollie Pope steps in the the shadow of 200; while Jamie Smith is 67 not out. Lovely bit of batting practice this. Essex’s lead stretches to 148, defiant in the face of Rushworth. Notts seven down, a couple of wickets for Danny Briggs. And at the Rose Bowl, Gubbins and White playing for the funeral (13 mins). If Somerset were relying on some heave-ho from Coverton, well, they’re out of luck. Bowled for two, a third wicket for Higgins. Gloucestershire polishing their shoes and preparing for a victory trot. Somerset 77-6. A second (8th) for Mohammad Abbas - two for six so far in this innings, to go with six for eleven in the first innings. Middlesex 40-3 and not long for this round. Essex lead reaches 132 - Allison 43 not out, Cook 21 not out. But does this mean batting is suddenly easy? Shall we spin it as good news for Durham? And Steven Croft reaches fifty, off 99 balls, five fours and a hand in a couple of run-outs. Essex lead now 127....Somerset 68-5...Glamorgan 96-4....Middlesex 32-2. And an email! From Tom vd Gucht: “Hello, Sorry about the terrible pun, but Yorkshire’s opener is enjoying a Lyth-ly (works as lively or lovely) start to the season as the top run scorer so far and with an impressive strike rate of 70. “Is he trying to put in a Chris Rogers style late career bid to get back into the test team, or gunning for the 1000 runs before the end of May, or both? Either way, an opener with a bit more dash might compliment Sibley in the test side and scoring quickly now might negate missed opportunities due to bad spring weather in his stab for 1000 runs before June!” Just checking, before I press send, and Lyth is definitely till there 79 not out (Yorks lead over Kent 239). The tepid sun has gone to Lancashire’s head. Another run out, with Jones gone for 8, one head not watching what the other head is doing. A truncated 70-minute afternoon session begins with a run out (Dave Vilas) and a couple of near misses. A lunchtime stroll - not as warm as it looks- revealed white hyacinths in flower outside the ground and dandelions bursting into less obedient puffs outside the pathway between the tram station and University Academy 92. An empty car park apart from two forlorn coaches and a steward in the sun reading the paper wishing only for a beer. This is the waiting sesssion - the calm before the storm.

Lancs 162-3 - Vilas 24, Croft 42. Lead a chucklesome 290. Umpires having a good natter, last off the field, as a member of the groundstaff strolls towards the middle with a large broom. Lunchtime scores to follow. In the games speeding towards completion: the Essex lead squeezes to 113; Allison a most Durham-frustrating 34 not out. Middlesex 11 without loss, despite four overs from Abbas. And Somerset 41-4 against Gloucestershire, who should be mentally preparing for some tail-end long-handle. Oh, correction! Hildreth was not out for a duck. Apologies all you Somerset fans. The bad news is that Somerset are 37-4. With Bartlett now out for a duck, Banton out for 18, Lammonby for a duck and Abell for 6. Hildreth is 7 not out and Somerset have a lead of only 40 over Gloucestershire. Gary Naylor pressing the case for time wasting. After an hour’s play: Essex have inched to a lead of 85, with only Harmer gone this morning, Worcestershire have reduced the deficit to 91 against Derbyshire, thanks to Ed Barnard (23) and Alzarri Joseph (40 not out). At Trent Bridge, Clarke and Hameed both out in the fifties - both to Olly Stone with a happy looking lead of 231. Wow, Ian Holland has got a hurry on, 143 not out, while Sam Northeast, who beat him to 100, is 118 not out. Hants’ lead a mere 546. Two wickets for Higgins, Somerset wobbling, 22-2, Lammonby out of a duck, Abell for six, Pope eases to 135 not out, while Foakes 84 not, as Surrey trail by just 56. A second wicket for Robinson - Glamorgan 44-2 -at Sophia Gardens ; Yorkies 62-1, a lead of 181 over Kent, while Lancs, after an early wobble have a comfortable lead of 245 over Northants. A fantastic picture of Ollie Robinson’s slip cordon. Oh dear, poor Tom Lammonby, a pair in the match as Somerset slip to 6-1. Keep an eye on Taunton: Somerset are batting again with a first innings lead of three runs and Glamorgan are batting again at Sophia Gardens - 29-0 after Sussex all out for 481. Cancel that, they’ve just lost a wicket: Selman lbw to Ollie Robinson, who is having some game. Four wickets, 67 and a wicket and possibilities to come. At The Oval, a century for Ollie Pope, with a succession of boundaries. It is his first since the Test at Port Elizabeth 22 innings ago. Off just 123 balls, 15 fours. I can’t seem to upload a photo but he’s wearing a light blue headband and looks like a springtime crocus. Essex’s hopes dripping away with Simon Harmer out for 6 - they lead by 58 with three wickets in hand. What do we think? A sniff if they can edge to 120? Elsewhere, a hundred for Sam Northeast, and, alas, Hameed out for 53, a second wicket for Will Rhodes Tap here for any of the nine games. And another! Alex Davies follows as Lancs lose two wickets in the first nine balls.64-2. Meanwhile, the king of spin has tapped out an ode of appreciation to Parky. Two balls later, he is out lbw. Lancs 64-1. And at The Oval play is delayed by pigeon poo. And a beautiful shot from Keaton Jennings off Sanderson to start the day, whizzing straight along the still damp grass, straight to the rope. Incidentally, am in mourning for Keaton Jennings’ 2020 curls - the 2021 look is far too brutal. Good morning from Old Trafford! The sun is out and the players are just going in after their warm-up. I’ve bought a coffee from Old Trafford’s own Cafe Nero and it feels like spring. Just to remind you all that all Championship games will pause between 2.50 and 4.10 as a mark of respect for Prince Philip’s funeral. Group 1 Derbyshire 390 all out v Worcestershire 243-7 Essex 96 and 208-6 v Durham 259 all out -ESSEX LEAD BY 45 Nottinghamshire 273 and 128-2 v Warwickshire 201-9 Group 2 Hampshire 319 all out and 204-2 v Middlesex 79 all out MOHAMMAD ABBAS 6-11 Somerset 312 v Gloucestershire 301-8 Surrey 253-3 v Leicestershire 375 all out Group 3 Glamorgan 285 v Sussex 481-9 Kent 265-9 v Yorkshire 379 Lancashire 305 and 60-0 v Northants 177 all out Good morning from Manchester where the sun rises gladly after Parky’s ball of the (new) century. Here is the man himself, mulling over his day’s work, “It’s very nice to play Championship cricket and pull the Red Rose on again. Having watched Simon Kerrigan bowl I knew I’d have a decent role to play and it was lovely to bowl a decent chunk of overs.”I was gutted to miss put on selection last week and just wanted to prove a point a guess.” On ‘that’ ball “I was very frustrated after Kerrigan slogged me for a few and just thought ‘sack it’ and tried to really rip it and luckily it paid off. There were decent foot holes there and I tried to bowl it quite fast. I know it’s doing the rounds on Twitter but to produce that for the team is fantastic and I’m very happy. It’s nice to have it trending on Twitter after the winter I’ve had but it’s nice just to play cricket.” Round the grounds, we’re expecting a result at the Rose Bowl after Sam Northeast and Ian Holland ground salt into the wound opened by Mohammad Abbass’s (un)believable 6-11 against Middlesex. Lancs are very on top against Northants, the Yorkies slept happy against Kent, Sussex batting out of their skins against Glamorgan, even stevens at Taunton and hundreds a-waiting to be collected by Pope and Foakes at Surrey, and Hameed and Clarke at Trent Bridge as Notts stare down that rare beast victory. The big question - can Durham really go on and beat the County Champions today, unbeaten at home for nearly three years? Essex just 45 ahead, a mere four wickets in hand. Nobody mention Simon Harmer.",

The Home Office uses the contractor Mitie to deport people to destinations including Jamaica, Pakistan, India, Nigeria and Ghana along with European countries and other locations. The escorts are only allowed to do this work if they have received accreditation from the Home Office. Muqaddas Zaib, a Mitie escort of Pakistani heritage, has brought a claim to an employment tribunal in south London based on race and disability discrimination, saying that he was treated less favourably than colleagues when it came to the distribution of removal jobs. Some jobs, such as those where a detainee might be violent or where the case has a high media profile, are deemed complex and can merit bonus payments. Zaib alleges discrimination claiming he was not given as many of these jobs as other colleagues. His disability discrimination claim is based on a medical condition which he said sometimes causes him physical problems. Mitie denies discrimination. In his evidence to the tribunal, Zaib said: “There is a culture of racism in the workforce.” He added that initially he was “too scared to make a complaint due to the culture and environment in the workplace”. Two witnesses for Zaib told the court about incidents where the term “cotton pickers” was used when referring to black staff.

          "bodyText": "As markets on both sides of the Atlantic hit fresh highs, boosted by hopes of an economic rebound from the crisis inflicted by the pandemic, tech companies are choosing their moment and queuing up to make their stock market debuts. The first three months of the year are traditionally a quiet period for initial public offerings (IPOs), but in 2021 its was the busiest quarter for listings in the past 20 years, according to accountancy firm EY – and tech companies dominated. The trend has continued in recent weeks, with tech firms boasting a combined valuation of more than $150bn (£108bn) announcing plans to float, clearly not put off by Deliveroo’s “flopperoo”, when the food delivery firm’s shares tanked on their market debut last month. More encouraging for firms was Coinbase’s blockbuster float on the Nasdaq last week. Shares in the US’s largest cryptocurrency exchange rose 58% at the start of trading, valuing the company at about $100bn. While the flurry of recent and planned IPOs has been dominated by the US, the UK is increasingly grabbing a piece of the action, as tech firms queue up to list on the London Stock Exchange. While London has long been renowned for its deep pool of investors and the liquidity of the market, the UK’s benchmark FTSE 100 index is still dominated by traditional companies such as oil giants, miners, banks and insurers. However, a wave of companies have announced their intention to float as investors hunt for places to put their money: they include online reseller MusicMagpie, online pension provider PensionBee, and British cybersecurity firm Darktrace. Darktrace, which is eyeing a £3bn listing, would become one of the rare “unicorns” – privately owned tech firms valued at more than $1bn – to enter the UK stock market. Another British unicorn, online card retailer Moonpig, floated in February and is currently valued at about £1.5bn. The latest trend in corporate finance, special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs), which raise money before looking for privately owned businesses to invest in and bring to market, was also responsible for a host of deals, according to EY. Chancellor Rishi Sunak does not want to miss out on this opportunity and is looking to liberalise rules about Spacs as part of sweeping reforms of the stock market to attract more fast-growing companies to the capital, rather than lose them to global rivals such as Amsterdam, New York and Hong Kong. The current flurry of tech IPOs is just the beginning of a “golden decade”, according to Stephen Kelly, chair of Tech Nation, a body that helps tech startups to grow. “It’s strategic to get at least 90% of UK tech companies to list in London, and a strategic goal has to be to attract international companies,” Kelly said. “I think this year we will see some companies from Canada, possibly the US and certainly the EU.” He also dismissed as a “myth” the suggestion that tech companies could achieve higher valuations in the US. MusicMagpie, which specialises in secondhand tech such as smartphones and games consoles, is one of the companies seizing the day. Founded in Stockport in 2007, the firm is planning a £208m flotation and decided London’s junior Aim market was the only place to list, according to its co-founder and chief executive, Steve Oliver. “We’ve got a US division, branded Decluttr. It’s about 25% of our business and a massively exciting further opportunity,” Oliver said. “But we are a UK-based business and London – and indeed Aim – was the only place we considered. For what we are, a fast-growing online tech business, it seemed the perfect home for us.” While many welcome tech companies’ interest in London listings, the dotcom crash of 2000 is seared into investors’ memories, and they will be on the lookout for signs of a bubble. The sector will probably continue to expand, according to Laura Hoy, equity analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown, as “ultra-low borrowing rates have created a supportive environment for new businesses”. However she cautioned that electric car stocks and cryptocurrencies were “starting to look a bit frothy” . A “danger sign” for Russ Mould, a director at investment firm AJ Bell, would be a series of copycat deals. “You wouldn’t want to suddenly see 53 cybersecurity companies all piling out the door at the same time. The early ones are going to be good, the later ones might be imitators, and the even later ones might not have much to them at all,” Mould said.",

          "body": "<p>When Boris Johnson first announced the government’s roadmap out of lockdown, hope burned gently inside me like a warming plate beneath a murgh makhani. In just a few weeks, I would be able to eat food cooked by someone other than myself, a feast to which I wouldn’t have to give a second thought – no shopping, no washing up – until the arrival of my credit card bill. What a relief. But where first? Mind racing, I pictured gorgeous, higgledy-piggledy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/30/noble-rot-soho-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent\" title=\"\">Noble Rot</a> in Soho. In that moment, I decided I would get there long before my companions, order two portions of those superlative little choux pastry buns filled with duck liver parfait and glazed with sauternes, and eat every last one myself, accompanied only by a large, cold glass of something the colour of an old wedding ring.</p> <p>For as long as it lasted, this was an extremely pleasing daydream. Like all the best fantasies, it was straightforward, unashamed and built for easy repetition. But then – pfff! – reality hit. You can more easily pass an aubergine through a pretzel than you can book a table in some restaurants right now - or perhaps in any restaurants at all. Certainly, if you want somewhere with outside space (no eating inside until next month), you can forget it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I already have a job, and thanks to this I’m unable to devote myself full-time to trawling restaurant websites</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If my experience is anything to go by, every last wonky pavement table has long since been bagged. For the future privilege of sitting in your winter coat with a blanket over your knees and no feeling whatsoever in your fingers and toes, your only hope is to join a waiting list. I once wrote in this column that “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/15/barack-obama-is-not-keen-on-pudding-this-means-we-can-never-be-friends\" title=\"\">I’m not having a starter</a>” are the most terrible words in the English language. Now I’m not so sure. “Would you like to go on the waiting list?” may be even worse. At least you know where you stand with the kind of killjoy who proceeds straight to their main course as if to the last bus home (“The bottom deck will do, thank you”).</p> <p>Having failed to get an outside table anywhere, I switched my attention to May, and the great indoors. Unfortunately, this hasn’t worked out either. I already have a job, and thanks to this I’m unable to devote myself full-time to trawling restaurant websites. At the moment, I have achieved one booking in London, in late May, and I am about to ask – to beg, in fact – to be added to the waiting list of a certain restaurant in York in early June. Yes, you read correctly. York’s bourgeoisie, it would appear, intend to be positively debauched in the coming weeks, staggering from Bettys to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/05/skosh-york-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Skosh</a> to Le Cochon Aveugle on some kind of crazed, endless loop. I’m going to take sandwiches and a flask when I visit, and at evensong in the Minster I will pray wildly for cancellations, and hope that the smell of the incense suppresses my appetite.</p> <p>Ah, cancellations. That’s another thing. During our various stretches of freedom last year, no-shows were a major problem for restaurants. But I sense it will be different this time, and not only because most now insist on credit card details, or even a deposit, to secure a booking. While the term “pent-up demand” used to seem to me like one only an estate agent would use – a ruse to justify loopy prices – these days, I’ve only to hear it to picture throbbing, pulsating humanity about to explode from nowhere; to hear the sound of a thousand voices demanding a wine list and wondering loudly what the specials are. It’s very real, this pent-up demand. It is clenched like a fist. If lots of us are vaccinated, even more are thoroughly fed up. Not since I was a child, and about to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/15/my-life-in-restaurants-rachel-cooke\" title=\"\">taken to a Berni Inn</a> for my birthday, have I felt such a sense of boiling anticipation at the thought of folded napkins and soft-voiced waiters.</p> <p>On which note, I’d better sign off. It’s time either to sharpen my virtual elbows once again, or to accept that, really, there’s nothing wrong at all with having a swank dinner at 4.30pm on a Monday afternoon (“and we’ll need the table back at 6.30pm”). Wish me luck as you wave me goodbye. </p>",

          "bodyText": "When Boris Johnson first announced the government’s roadmap out of lockdown, hope burned gently inside me like a warming plate beneath a murgh makhani. In just a few weeks, I would be able to eat food cooked by someone other than myself, a feast to which I wouldn’t have to give a second thought – no shopping, no washing up – until the arrival of my credit card bill. What a relief. But where first? Mind racing, I pictured gorgeous, higgledy-piggledy Noble Rot in Soho. In that moment, I decided I would get there long before my companions, order two portions of those superlative little choux pastry buns filled with duck liver parfait and glazed with sauternes, and eat every last one myself, accompanied only by a large, cold glass of something the colour of an old wedding ring. For as long as it lasted, this was an extremely pleasing daydream. Like all the best fantasies, it was straightforward, unashamed and built for easy repetition. But then – pfff! – reality hit. You can more easily pass an aubergine through a pretzel than you can book a table in some restaurants right now - or perhaps in any restaurants at all. Certainly, if you want somewhere with outside space (no eating inside until next month), you can forget it. If my experience is anything to go by, every last wonky pavement table has long since been bagged. For the future privilege of sitting in your winter coat with a blanket over your knees and no feeling whatsoever in your fingers and toes, your only hope is to join a waiting list. I once wrote in this column that “I’m not having a starter” are the most terrible words in the English language. Now I’m not so sure. “Would you like to go on the waiting list?” may be even worse. At least you know where you stand with the kind of killjoy who proceeds straight to their main course as if to the last bus home (“The bottom deck will do, thank you”). Having failed to get an outside table anywhere, I switched my attention to May, and the great indoors. Unfortunately, this hasn’t worked out either. I already have a job, and thanks to this I’m unable to devote myself full-time to trawling restaurant websites. At the moment, I have achieved one booking in London, in late May, and I am about to ask – to beg, in fact – to be added to the waiting list of a certain restaurant in York in early June. Yes, you read correctly. York’s bourgeoisie, it would appear, intend to be positively debauched in the coming weeks, staggering from Bettys to Skosh to Le Cochon Aveugle on some kind of crazed, endless loop. I’m going to take sandwiches and a flask when I visit, and at evensong in the Minster I will pray wildly for cancellations, and hope that the smell of the incense suppresses my appetite. Ah, cancellations. That’s another thing. During our various stretches of freedom last year, no-shows were a major problem for restaurants. But I sense it will be different this time, and not only because most now insist on credit card details, or even a deposit, to secure a booking. While the term “pent-up demand” used to seem to me like one only an estate agent would use – a ruse to justify loopy prices – these days, I’ve only to hear it to picture throbbing, pulsating humanity about to explode from nowhere; to hear the sound of a thousand voices demanding a wine list and wondering loudly what the specials are. It’s very real, this pent-up demand. It is clenched like a fist. If lots of us are vaccinated, even more are thoroughly fed up. Not since I was a child, and about to be taken to a Berni Inn for my birthday, have I felt such a sense of boiling anticipation at the thought of folded napkins and soft-voiced waiters. On which note, I’d better sign off. It’s time either to sharpen my virtual elbows once again, or to accept that, really, there’s nothing wrong at all with having a swank dinner at 4.30pm on a Monday afternoon (“and we’ll need the table back at 6.30pm”). Wish me luck as you wave me goodbye.",
